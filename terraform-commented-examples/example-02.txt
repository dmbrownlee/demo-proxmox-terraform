# A simple example that creates a text file in the current directory.

# Here is our terraform block again, only this time, we have specified 
# which version of terraform the .tf file requires.  If you have an
# older version of terraform installed, it will complain about your
# version being too old.

# We've also added a required_providers block.  Providers are plugins
# that extend terraform's functionality.  The "local" provider is an
# official provider from HashiCorp that allows terraform to manage
# local files.  You can also require specific versions of the providers
# you use as we did here.  Since providers are downloaded and installed
# when you run "terraform init", you will need to re-run that command
# if you make changes to these blocks.

# Run this now:
#   terraform init

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.7.1"
  required_providers {
    local = {
      source = "hashicorp/local"
      version = ">= 2.4.0"
    }
  }
}

# TIP: terraform maintains a hidden file, .terraform.lock.hcl, that
# pins the versions of terraform and your providers when you run
# terraform init.
