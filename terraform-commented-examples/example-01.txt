# This is as simple as it gets, an empty terraform block.  When you run terraform,
# it concatenates all the files with a .tf extension and uses that combined file
# as its configuration file.

# In order to run this example file, you need to rename it with a .tf extension or
# create a symbolic link to it with a .tf extension.
# Example:
#   ln -s example-01.txt main.tf

# First, run:
#   terraform init
#
# This tells terraform to initialize itself.  If we had defined addinational
# providers (think plugins), terraform init would download and install them.
# 
# Next, you can run:
#   terraform validate
#
# This causes terraform to check the syntax of your combined .tf files for
# syntax errors.  This file is so empty, there isn't any room for errors.
#
# Next, you can run:
#   terraform apply
#
# This tells terraform to compare the resources defined in the .tf files with
# what actually exists and will offer to create any missing reosources and
# modify existing resources if their attributes are different than what we
# specified.  Since we didn't define any resources, nothing needs to be 
# created.
#
# Finally, you can run:
#   terraform destroy
#
# This tells terraform to destroy any resources it manages.  In this case,
# it will tell you no resources need to be destroyed because none have
# been created.

terraform {
}
